# Machine Learning Steps
# 1 - Import the data
# 2 - Clean the data
# 3 - Split data. Training Set/Test Set
# 4 - Create a Model 
# 5 - Check the output
# 6 - Improve

# Important Tools:
# 1-NumPy ( for working with arrays and lists )
# 2-pandas ( for working with csv files or datasets or modifying them )
# 3-scikit-learn ( for importing necessayr algorithms/models/functions )
# 4-matplotlib ( for visualising our data )
# 5-jupiter notebooks ( environment to code )
# 6-kaggle ( ml and ds community /free access to datasets /compete /much more )
